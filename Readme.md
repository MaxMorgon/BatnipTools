# ðŸ§° Batnip Unity Editor Tools

A small Unity package with editor productivity tools to improve your workflow. Includes a custom toolbar extender, quick object creation utility, and a visual compilation reminder.

## âœ¨ Features

### 1. **Toolbar Extender (Modified)**
A very lightly modified version of the popular Toolbar Extender by marinz. Original : https://github.com/marijnz/unity-toolbar-extender
This addon allows you to hook into and customize the Unity toolbar UI.
Was modified to support the compile reminder light feature.

### 2. **Quick Create**
Quickly create objects in the Scene or Project using a fast, searchable filter-based menu. Ideal for reducing the friction of creating assets that are deep in menus or frequently visiting the right-click->create menus.

### 3. **Compile Reminder Light**
A small indicator light near the Play button that warns you if there are unapplied script changes that still need compilation. Helps avoid entering Play mode with stale code.
